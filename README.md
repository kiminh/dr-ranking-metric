### Dependencies

- numpy==1.19.1
- pandas==1.1.2
- scikit-learn==0.23.1
- tensorflow==1.15.4
- lightfm==1.15.0

### Datasets
To run the simulations, the following datasets need to be prepared as described below.

- download the [Yahoo! R3 dataset](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=r) and put `train.txt` and `test.txt` files into `./data/yahoo/` directory.
- download the [Coat dataset](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~schnabts/mnar/) and put `train.ascii` and `test.ascii` files into `./data/coat/` directory.

### Running the code

To run the real-world experiment, navigate to the `src/` directory and run the following commands

```bash
python main.py --num_sims 5 --data coat
```

```bash
python main.py --num_sims 20 --data yahoo
```

Once the code is finished executing, you can find the summarized results (relative-RMSEs, lower value is better) in `./results/` directory.
